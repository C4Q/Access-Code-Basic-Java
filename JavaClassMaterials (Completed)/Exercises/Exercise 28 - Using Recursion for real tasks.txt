Exercise 28: Recursion with an array

Insert the following array of numbers into a class:

int[] arr = {3,5,9,4,10,33,12,19,4,15,23,30};

insert statements to call the recursive methods below and print the results from each:



Write and run the following recursive methods from within main:


public static int largest(int[] myArray, int index) {
//The largest number in the array is the larger of the first number in the array, and 
//the largest number in the rest of the array.
}


public static int sum (int[] myArray, int index) {
//The sum of the numbers in the array is the first number plus the sum of the rest of the  
//numbers in the array.

}


public static Boolean isSorted(int[] myArray, int index) {
//The array is sorted if the first number in the array is less than or equal to the second
//number in the array, and the rest of the array is sorted.

}


public static void print( int[] myArray) {
//Write a recursive method which prints the values of each int in the list from 
//first to last. 
}


public static void printReverse( int[] myArray) {
//Write a recursive method which prints the values of each int in the list from 
//last to first. 
}


public static int evenSum(int [] myArray) {
//Write a recursive method which finds the sum of all the even ints in the list. 
}


public static int primeSum(int [] myArray) {
//Write a recursive method which finds the sum of only the primes in the list.
}

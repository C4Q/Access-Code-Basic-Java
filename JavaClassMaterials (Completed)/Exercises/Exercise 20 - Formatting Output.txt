Exercise 20: Formatting output


Taken an array of numbers as shown below: 

int[][] array = { {42, 628, 1, 98765, 14}, {8, 2543, 44, 2, 24631} ,  {8241, 36210, 2, 5, 234} }; 

Use Formatter or format methods of string and System.out to output the 2D array where each element
is aligned correctly in its own row and column.

Hint: use a nested for loop.

/*

Exercise 7: How many times? 

Write a program that will take in a provided text file that consists of many numbers, then examine the numbers and 
determine which number or numbers appeared the most number of times.  Output each number and how many times it appeared, 
then output how many times the most common number(s) appeared, and what number(s) that did.

**Don't forget to include your file input inside a Try block and Catch exceptions**
**Make sure the input file is saved to the correct project folder in your workspace**

Hint: As all the numbers are between 1 and 99, you may wish to use an array of size 100 to keep track of how many each 
number appears.

See one possible solution below.

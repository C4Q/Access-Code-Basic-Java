/*

Exercise 22: Using Maps

Make a class familyMember (or use the Student class from an old example or exercise) that contains at least three data members:
String firstName
String lastName
String relationship
int age

Create instances for several family members (at least 4) and fill in each data member in some way (constructors or set 
methods).  Then create a TreeMap and assign each family member to an entry, with the key being the firstName.  

Note: this means that the firstName should be both a data member of the class AND the key used to look up the information.
If you have two people with the same firstName, include the middle name following the first name, or Junion, Senior, etc.

Display all the entries in this map by printing.
Display all the keys using keyset.
Display all the values using .values().

Use different methods to manipulate the data contained in this map.  

Use the iterator class to display the keys one at a time with their associated values.

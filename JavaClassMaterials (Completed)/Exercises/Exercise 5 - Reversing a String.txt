Exercise 5: Reversing a string

Write a program that will take in a word from the user, then outputs the original String, then that string in 
reverse order.  The program will then prompt for another word and repeat until the word STOP, stop, Stop, or any 
uppercase/lowercase variation of "stop" is typed in.  

For example:
If the original sentence is: JurassicPark!
The reversed output should be: !kraPcissaruJ



Hint 1: For the repetition, it is best to use an infinite loop and break when "stop" is entered.  Remember to look at 
String methods for help withi all variations of "stop"

Hint 2: There are several ways to complete this exercise, some very complicated, some very simple.  It may be helpful 
to use StringBuilder and examine the API for it.

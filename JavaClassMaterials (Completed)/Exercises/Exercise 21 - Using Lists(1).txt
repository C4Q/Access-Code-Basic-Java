Exercise 21: Using Lists


Using the classes Computer, Laptop, and Desktop from Exercise 16, either make a new main
class that that will make an ArrayList  of Computer objects.  
Then add the following 5 following computer objects to that list using appropriate methods:

Laptop:   "Toshiba", "Satellite", 1299.50, .25, "yes"
Laptop:   "Apple", "MacBook Air", 1759.50, .33 
Desktop:  "Dell", "Inspiron", 449.99, .10 
Desktop:  "HP", "Pavilion", 799.99, .05 
Laptop:   "Acer", "Aspire", 899.99, .15 

Display the information on this list to the console.

Remove the HP Pavilion computer from the list and add the following computers to the 
end of the list using appropriate methods: 

Laptop:   "Sony", "VAIO", 1199.99, .25
Desktop:  "Alienware", "Aurora", 1499.88, .10

Display the new list.

Experiment with various other methods that exist with the List interface.

Make sure you use at least the methods we discussed in class (on powerpoint and example)



Now do the same for LinkedList.  Observe the similarities.  

Look at the Java API and the "dot operator" shortcut in eclipse and try to find
some methods that are UNIQUE to ArrayList and LinkedList (meaning they do not appear in 
the other.)  Choose 3 of these methods.  On paper with your name, explain why these methods
makes sense ONLY for that type of List by your next Lecture class.  Be prepared to hand it 
in and explain your answer.

Exercise 23: Using Maps to help with complex tasks

Use the input from Example 13, create a TreeMap that consists of entries that have Strings keys, and integer values.

Read each word in from the input document.  If it is the first time encountered, add it to the TreeMap with the key 
being that word and a value of 0.  If it has been encountered before, increase the value by 1.  


After completing this TreeMap, display the full map in an organized way (using Iterator).
Display how many times the most repeated word occurs.  

Is there an easy way to display this word?  In other words, can the key associated with this value be printed to console?

/*
Example 5: Guessing Game with break

This is identical to the code for Example 4, except that it contains the use of the keyword 'break'.
It will automatically leave the while loop and continue the code.  

Please make sure that you understand how the keyword 'break' is used. 
As usual, you are encouraged to look up details in the Java API.

Here is another useful source on the usage of 'break':

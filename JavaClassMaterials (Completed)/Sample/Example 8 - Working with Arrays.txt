/*
Example 8: Working with arrays

This code is to show how arrays work in Java.  There are several important things to note here.

Two arrays are created, nums[] and marks[].  The [] in the declaration may be placed with the data type 
or with the name of the array and will not change the result.  However, convention states that we place the []
next to the data type.  

The array nums is size 7 and contains the numbers 1-7.

The array marks is size 5 and contains all 0's, until the element at index 1 is assigned a value of 98.


If we remove the comment marks around System.out.println(nums[7]);, we would get an exception.  
This is because the nums array is of size 7, and only has index values of 0 to 6.

public class ArrayTest {

	public static void main(String[] args) {

		int[] nums = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7};
		
		int marks[] = new int [5];
		
		marks[1] = 98;
		
		System.out.println(nums[0]);
		System.out.println(nums[1]);
		System.out.println(nums[2]);
		System.out.println(nums[3]);
//		System.out.println(nums[7]);
		
		System.out.println(marks[0]);
		System.out.println(marks[1]);
	}

/*
Example 6: Static Methods

This is a program that is very similar to Exercise 1 from Monday 7/9.
However, this program includes the use of a single static function to calculate area rather than
calculation within main.

This is an example of calling a static method from the main class (also a static class). 



Note1: Rather than importing java.util.Scanner; we have used the shortcut of import java.util.*; Recall that 
this brings every class in the util package into the code.

Note2: The name of the Scanner object so far has always been "input".  This is not required, and in this example
we can see that it has instead been named "inKey".  "input" is not a keyword, simply a convenient name for a 
Scanner object.

	public static void main(String[] args) {

		Scanner inKey= new Scanner(System.in);

		System.out.println("This program will determine the area of rectangle.");
		System.out.println();

		System.out.print("Enter the length of the rectangle: ");
		double length;
		length = inKey.nextDouble();

		System.out.print("Enter the width of the rectangle: ");
		double width;
		width = inKey.nextDouble();

		double area = calculateArea(length, width);


		System.out.println();

		System.out.println("The length of the rectangle is " + length + " inches."); 
		System.out.println("The width of the rectangle is " + width + " inches.");
		System.out.println("The area of the rectangle is " + area + " square inches.");

/*
Example 4: Guessing Game with the Random utility (if and while loops)

This program allows the user to play a simple game of guessing a number between 1 and 10.  
Program will give the user a hint if the guess is too big or small.

Please make sure that you understand the format of the while loop and the if/else blocks.



Note: We must import the Random class and create an object from it (rand).  
From this code, we can see one method, rand.nextInt(10), returns a random integer from 0 to 9.
We can use the Java API to get other functions of this class.

Example 7: Overloading Functions

This code is very similar to Example 6, however, this also allows for the possibility of a single variable,
the length of the side of the square, through the use of the if/elseif/else constructs.  Note that two functions 
exist in this code and both are named "calculateArea".  However, since they have different parameters, Java is able 
to determine which of the two methods should be used. 

This is an example of calling a static method from the main class (also a static class).

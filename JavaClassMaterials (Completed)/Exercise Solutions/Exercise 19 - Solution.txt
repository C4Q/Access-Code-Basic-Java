/*

Exercise 19: Using an interface

Create a new interface called electricDevice with the single method getPowerUsed().  

Create a new class called Television with whatever data members and methods you wish or decide are needed.

Have the 3 classes from Exercise 16 (Computer, Laptop, and Desktop), and the new class Television all implement 
the interface electricDevice.  

Create the method within each class to implement the abstract method getPowerUsed() from the interface.  
Televisions should give a string "300 watts", Computers should give a string "Error - More Information Needed", 
Laptops should give a string "50 watts", and Desktops should give a string "130 watts"

In a main function, create an array of size 4 called device made using the interface electricDevice.  Fill the 
array with one of each of the objects (Computer, Laptop, Desktop, and Television).  Use a for each loop to 
reveal the power used by each of the objects in the array.

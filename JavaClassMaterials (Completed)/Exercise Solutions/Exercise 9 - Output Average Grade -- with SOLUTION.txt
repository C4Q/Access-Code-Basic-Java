/*

Exercise 9: Output Average Grades

Use your solution to Exercise 4 from Tuesday 7/10 to complete this problem.


Modify your code to do the following: 

1. Ask for the name of the student before taking in 5 grades.  
2. Create a loop that would allow this program to repeat until the name entered equals any variation of "done"
3. Output the name of each student followed by their 5 grades followed by the average TO A FILE.


One possible solution is found below.

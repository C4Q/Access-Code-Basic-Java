Exercise 17: Abstract Class

Create an abstract class called Vehicle.  Give it whatever data members and methods you wish, but make sure 
it includes at least one data member for an abstract method getSoundSample().  
Create classes called Automobile, Train, and Plane derived from the superclass vehicle.  These classes should 
implement abstract method to return a String that shows what sound the vehicle makes.

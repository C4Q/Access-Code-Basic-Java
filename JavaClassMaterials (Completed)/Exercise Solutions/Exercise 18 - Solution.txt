Exercise 18: Using instanceof

Using the classes from Exercise 16 (Computer, Laptop, Desktop), create a main function that creates an array of 
computer of size 7 that fills the array with Computer, Laptop, and/or Desktop objects.  

Use instanceof to iterate through the array and output the number of each that exist within the array.

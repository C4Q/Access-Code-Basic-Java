Exercise 16: The Computer, Laptop, and Desktop class


Write a class called computer that has the data members: 
	String brand;
	String model;
	double price;
	double discount;

It should have a default constructor that initializes the strings to "" and doubles to 0.
It should have constructor that takes in 2 Strings and 2 doubles and initializes them.

There should be a get and set method for all of the 4 data members.

There should be a method getSalePrice, which is determined by price * (1-discount).
There should be a method getAmountOff, which is determined by price * discount.

There should be a toString method that will return all the data members (including the discount 
as a percentage), as well as the sale price and amount off. 

Within Computer, write a main function, create 5 new computers with the following information:
	Toshiba, Satellite, 1299.50, .25
	Apple, MacBook Air, 1759.50, .33
	Dell, Inspiron, 449.99, .10
	HP, Pavilion, 799.99, .05
	Acer, Aspire, 899.99, .15

Then print out each new object using the toString method.






Write a class called Desktop that extends Computer that has the data member:
	String monitor;

Create a default constructor that does nothing.

Create a constructor that takes in 2 Strings and 2 doubles and uses the super keyword to initialize
them with the Computer constructor.  This constructor will initialize the data member monitor to "none"

Create a constructor that takes in 2 Strings, 2 doubles, and another String.  The super keyword should
be used to initialize the Computer data members as before, and the final String should initialize monitor.

Create a get and set method for the monitor.

Create a toString method that will return all information from the Computer toString method as well as the
information about the monitor.  Hint: You may use super.toString() to call the toString method of the 
superclass and use + to concatenate.

Within Desktop, write a main function, create a new computer with the following information:
	Dell, Inspiron, 449.99, .10, touch screen

Then print out this object using the toString method.





Write a class called Laptop that extends Computer that has the data members:
	String tablet;
	double weight;

Create a default constructor that does nothing

Create a constructor that takes in 2 Strings and 2 doubles and uses the super keyword to initialize
them with the Computer constructor.  This constructor will initialize the data member weight to 5 and
the data member tablet to "none"

Create a get and set method for tablet and weight.

Create a toString method that will return all information from the Computer toString method as well as the
information about the tablet and weight.  Hint: You may use super.toString() to call the toString method of the 
superclass and use + to concatenate.

Within Desktop, write a main function, create a new computer with the following information:
	Dell, Inspiron, 449.99, .10, regular

Then print out this object using the toString method.

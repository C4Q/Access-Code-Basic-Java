/*
Exercise 14: Interaction between classes

Create a class call Grade then perform the following tasks: 
	a. Declare data members: 
		i. Grade 
		ii. Weight in percentage 
	b. Methods: 
		i. Get and set grades and weight 
		ii. getWeightedGrade = grades * weight 

Create a class call Student then perform the following tasks: 
	a. Setup the following data members: 
		i. firstName 
		ii. lastName 
		iii. Grades array (defined in pervious question) 
	b. Define the following methods: 
		i. Get and set methods for first and last name 
		ii. Create addGrade methods and geGrades method return array 
		iii. getFinalGrade – sum of all weighted grades 

Note: make sure that these two classes exist within the same project folder

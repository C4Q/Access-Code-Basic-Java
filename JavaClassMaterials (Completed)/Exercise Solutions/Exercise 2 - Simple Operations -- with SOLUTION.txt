Exercise 2: Simple Java operations

Write a program that prompts the user to enter two numbers, then outputs the following:  
1. The sum of those two numbers.
2. The product of those two numbers.
3. The difference of those two numbers (first number minus the second number).
4. The quotient of those two numbers (first number divided by the second number).
5. The remainder of division (modulo, symbol %) of those two numbers (first number divided by the second number).

The sum, product, difference, quotient, and remainder should all be int values.    
The output should be a string printed to console with the above int values concatenated to the string.


For example, if the two numbers entered are 10 and 2, the results should be: 
The sum of those numbers is: 12.
The product of those numbers is: 20.
The difference of those numbers is: 8.
The quotient of those numbers is: 5.
The remainder of division is: 0.

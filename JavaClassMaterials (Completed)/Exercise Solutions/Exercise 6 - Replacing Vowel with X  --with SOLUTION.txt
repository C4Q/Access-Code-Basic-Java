Exercise 6: Replacing Vowels with X

Write a program that will take in a sentence from the user, then change all vowels (uppercase and lowercase) 
into the char 'x'.  Output the original sentence and the new sentence to the console when completed.



Hint 1: You may wish to use a delimiter to take in a full sentence

Hint 2: StringBuilder is a very useful took for String alteration.  Pay close attention to StringBuilder methods such as 
- .length()
- .charAt(index)
- .setCharAt(index, char)

All found in the API


One possible solution is shown below.
